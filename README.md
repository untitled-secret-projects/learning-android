# learning-android
repository for learning android

# Set-up
First, generate and add your computer's SSH key into your GitHub Account using the guide here: https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/

Next, clone the repository into your desktop. This creates a working folder directory for you to start working from.

# First Step: Learning Git / Github

Before starting out, it's good to get an idea of how to use GitHub. As we go along the Android learning process, we can integrate git into our learning to get used to working with GitHub. Also, it acts as a back-up to prevent the loss of any programs we create.

There is a very good tutorial here: https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial

It takes around half a day to complete.

# Using Git during learning

The basic idea is to create a branch for each of us as we learn. We can commit and "save" our work in our individual branches which can be viewed by everyone.

As we reach key junctures in our individual learning we can commit it into the master branch which will be the main repository.

Later on, branches will be used to edit existing pieces of the code so that everyone can tackle different features. But for now, we can learn and edit in our own directories (folders).

# Tools to download.

1. Android Studio. This is an Integrated Development Environment to write your code and test the
applications.
2. Before trying out 3, I recommend trying out https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-bash-
shell-command-line-windows-10 which Microsoft has recently created on windows 10 to make
windows 10 more developer friendly. This enables linux/MACOS terminal commands in a
native bash terminal (useful for git and many other open source commands).
3. If you do not want to download Linux, and want to work in windows 10, download
https://gitforwindows.org/ for Git integration with a bash terminal.

# Next Step: Learning Android

For now, we should use the UDACITY course created by google:

If you find other great resources out there, please initiate a pull request (basically a request to add it into this readme page!)

Google also has a text resource here: https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/
